# FantraxBot

## About

This is a project that I have wanted to do for a very long time. We have a Discord group with over 10 of my friends in, who all play fantasy football on Fantrax. I have wanted to add some tracking features to the group for a while, but no third-party bots that I could find will allow me to do it.

Then I found my Raspberry Pi and decided to re-purpose it as an always-on Discord bot!

## Features

The bot can do the following:

- Create and store reactions which can be called upon by any user, and the bot will respond
    - Creation of the reactions can be done by any admin with the `!react` command
    - Reactions can have other arguments passed in, such as:
        - "used anywhere" if the reaction can be triggered anywhere in a message
        - "case sensitive" if the reaction only triggers with correct casing
- Tracking of the ðŸŸ¥ emoji reaction on anybody's posts, which then posts a citation to a #red-card channel, for approval by an admin
    - Nominated red cards and confirmed red cards are both tracked, with punishments at the end of the season for the person with the most red cards for foul play
    - A red card can be given a mean comment or unsavoury response
    - Only myself and a red card approver can mark the red card as "official" using the reaction emotes at the bottom of the post
    - Declining a red card will still leave it on a person's record but as a "nominated" red card instead of an official one. Only "official" red cards count
    - Accepting a red card will put a ðŸŸ¥ emoji at the bottom of the post in the #red-card channel to show it's confirmed to users
    - Each user gets 5 cards to give out a month - a check is done whenever a red card is given to see if the allocation needs to be updated

- Tracking of a "Slow Sports News" emoji reaction, which can be placed on any post which might be deemed repeat information or slow news
- `!cards` can be called by individual users to see how many cards they have

- `!mute` and `!unmute` can be used with an @mention argument to mute/unmute a user
    - Syntax is `!mute @user` or `!unmute @user`
- `!scores` will take a screenshot from the Fantrax standings page for our league, after scrolling to the bottom for this gameweek, and post it in the channel the command was requested from
- `!meme` takes a random image from a JSON file, and posts it to the channel requested
- `!prune` will allow the user to prune the last 1-99 messages
    - Syntax is `!prune <int from 1-99>`
- `!poll` will produce an embedded poll post that allows users to choose 1x reaction from a multiple choice selection (up to 10 options) - and set a time limit on the poll too
    - Syntax is `!poll <Poll title>;<option 1>,<option 2>,<option 3>,<etc>;<Time in seconds>`

- `!send` allows administrators to send messages as the Bot. Bot reads whatever the content of the message is, and redistributes it to the specified channel
    - Syntax is `!send <channel name> <message - can include links, @mentions, Discord formatting>`
   

- `!reload` can be used while the bot is running to reload any command file that might have been altered
    - Run `!reload <command name>` to trigger without needing to restart the bot
- Commands can be dynamically added - just add JavaScript files to the commands folder and module.exports them to index.js - no extra code required!
